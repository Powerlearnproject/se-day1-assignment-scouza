Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Its the application of engineering principles , methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Importance : Enables the creation of software application and systems that power various aspects of modern life eg.communication.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Development of programming languages e.g Fortran
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3.The advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements : Gathering and documenting user needs and software requirements
2.Design :Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3.Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4.Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
6.Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfal methodologies refers to the sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like waterfall eg. requirements while agile methodolohy is  the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility ,collaboration ,and responding to change
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.




Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing ,debugging and testing code eg.Eclipse.VCS are the software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays
2.Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3.Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.




Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Its the crafting of questions to get the best possible responses from AI models.
This helps improve the perfomance of AI by leading to more clear ,accurate and consice responses

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
'Tell me about connective tissue'
'Tell me about the charateristics, types and functions of connective tissue'
In the second question the AI is likely to give a more detailed information about connective tissue.
